# PUF-User-Java-API
Java APIs to enable software applications to use hardware-based Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for secure key derivation, encryption and hash operations.  These APIs will be used directly by an application to perform these crypto- operations with the key generated by and protected by the hardware PUF.
